In this project, I've implemented the concept of LSB steganography, a technique used to hide data within the least significant bits of an image's pixel values. It's a fascinating way to embed secret messages or information within images without altering their perceptible appearance.
This project implements LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography in C, a technique used to hide data within the least significant bits of an image's pixel values. It provides functionalities to embed secret messages or information within images without altering their perceptible appearance, as well as extract hidden messages from steganographic images.

Features
Embedding: Hide messages or data within image files using LSB manipulation.
Extraction: Extract hidden messages from steganographic images without any loss.
Efficiency: Built entirely in C for efficiency and portability.
